# Security Architecture Options for Eurogrid

## Current Problem
- Private buckets aren't visible to anonymous Supabase keys
- Making bucket "public" feels wrong for paid NFT-style collectibles

## Better Architecture Options:

### Option 1: Backend API Server (Most Secure) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Create a simple backend (Node.js/Deno/Python)
- Backend uses SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (never exposed to frontend)
- Frontend requests images through your API
- API validates user's purchases before serving images
- Full control over access logic

**Pros:** Most secure, full control, can track usage
**Cons:** Requires hosting a backend server

### Option 2: Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Use Supabase Edge Functions as your backend
- Edge function has access to service role key
- Frontend calls edge function to get signed URLs
- Edge function checks user's purchases in database first

**Pros:** Serverless, secure, stays within Supabase
**Cons:** Slight learning curve for Edge Functions

### Option 3: Database-Driven Access ⭐⭐⭐
- Store purchase records in Supabase database
- Use Row Level Security on purchase table
- Generate signed URLs only for purchased items
- Frontend checks database before requesting images

**Pros:** No backend needed, uses Supabase features
**Cons:** More complex client-side logic

### Option 4: Public Bucket + Encrypted Files ⭐⭐
- Make bucket public but encrypt the GIF files
- Store decryption keys in secure database
- Decrypt on client after verifying purchase

**Pros:** Files are useless without keys
**Cons:** Complex implementation, client-side decryption

## My Recommendation: Supabase Edge Functions

Here's why:
1. Keeps service key secure (never in frontend)
2. You can verify purchases before serving files
3. No additional hosting costs
4. Easy to add purchase validation logic
5. Can implement rate limiting, watermarking, etc.

## Quick Implementation Plan:
1. Create Edge Function that:
   - Accepts: module_id, user_id
   - Checks: user owns this module (database lookup)
   - Returns: signed URL if authorized
2. Frontend calls Edge Function instead of storage directly
3. Edge Function uses service_role_key internally

Would you like me to:
1. Set up a Supabase Edge Function for secure access?
2. Create a simple purchase/ownership database schema?
3. Or continue with public bucket for now and upgrade security later?

The public bucket approach CAN work if we:
- Add watermarks to "preview" versions
- Use database to track real ownership
- Only show full quality after purchase verification
