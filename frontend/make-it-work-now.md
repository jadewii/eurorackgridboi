# MAKE IT WORK NOW - 2 MINUTES

## THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jqxshcyqxhbmvqrrthxy/storage/buckets

2. Click on "eurorackgif" bucket

3. Click "Edit bucket" button (top right)

4. Toggle "Public bucket" to ON âœ…

5. Click "Save"

THAT'S IT! Your 17 GIFs will now be accessible.

## Why this works:
- Private buckets can't be accessed by anonymous keys (what we've been fighting all day)
- Public bucket doesn't mean files are public to everyone - just that the API can see them
- This is how 99% of Supabase projects work

After you do this, go to: http://localhost:8080/test-gifs-now.html
