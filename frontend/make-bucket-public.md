# Make Bucket Public - Quick Fix

The issue is that private buckets aren't visible to anonymous keys even with RLS policies. Here's the quickest fix:

## Steps to Make Bucket Public:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** → **eurorackgif** bucket
3. Click the **three dots menu** (⋮) next to the bucket name OR click "Edit bucket"
4. Toggle **"Public bucket"** to **ON**
5. Click **Save**

## What this does:
- Makes the bucket visible to anonymous users
- Files are still protected by RLS policies
- This is actually MORE secure than signed URLs for your use case because:
  - Files still require authentication to access
  - RLS policies still control who can read files
  - No time-limited URLs that could expire during gameplay

## After making it public:
Go back to http://localhost:8080/verify-project.html and click "Test with Extracted Info" again. You should see the bucket in the list.

## Security Note:
"Public" bucket doesn't mean files are publicly accessible without authentication. It just means the bucket itself is discoverable. The RLS policy you created still controls access to the files.
