### Copy These Two Things:

**Project URL:**

```
â†‘ Click the copy button next to it

**anon public:**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.[long-string]...
```

2. Your anon key

And I'll update all the files for you!

**Can't find them?** 

The API page looks like this:
- **Project URL** is at the top
- **anon public** is in the "Project API keys" section
- Both have copy buttons (ðŸ“‹) next to them

Just paste them in the chat and I'll handle everything!
