# üñºÔ∏è GETTING YOUR IMAGES WORKING - THE SIMPLE WAY

## Current Situation:
- Your images are on Supabase (slow, crashing)
- You have module names but not the final images yet
- You want them loading FAST so you can test

## The SIMPLEST Solution Right Now:

### Option 1: Cloudflare R2 (Recommended - FAST & FREE)
1. **Sign up** (5 minutes):
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
   - Create free account
   - Click "R2" in sidebar
   - Create bucket: "eurorackgrid"
   - Make it public

2. **Upload placeholder images** (we'll create them):
   - I'll generate placeholder WebP files
   - Upload to R2
   - They'll load INSTANTLY worldwide

### Option 2: Use Local Images for Testing
1. Create a `modules` folder in your project
2. Put placeholder images there
3. Test locally with Python server:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jade/eurogrid/frontend
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Visit: http://localhost:8000

## Your Module List (from your HTML):
- Function Synthesizer
- Honduh
- Andersons
- Varigated
- BAI
- Cephalopod Rose
- Physical Modeler
- Voltaged Gray
- Complex Oscillator
- Textural Synthesizer
- Mangler and Tangler
- Altered Black

## Let's Create Placeholder Images NOW:

I can create simple colored squares with module names that will:
- Load instantly
- Be the right size (300x300)
- Work as placeholders until you have real images
- Be easy to replace later

Want me to create these placeholder images so we can test loading speed?
