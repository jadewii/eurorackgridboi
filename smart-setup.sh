🧠 SMART SETUP FOR EURORACKGRID
================================

This is the SIMPLEST way that actually WORKS:

STEP 1: Create GitHub repo for images (FREE forever)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: github.com/new
2. Create repo: 'eurorackgrid-assets'
3. Make it PUBLIC
4. Upload your /frontend/webp folder
5. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings
6. Your images are now at:
   https://[your-username].github.io/eurorackgrid-assets/webp/module-name.webp

STEP 2: Deploy website to Netlify (FREE)
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to: app.netlify.com
2. Drag your 'frontend' folder to Netlify
3. It gives you a URL instantly!
4. Connect your domain (eurorackgrid.com)

STEP 3: Keep using localStorage for now
----------------------------------------
- Your current system WORKS
- It's actually fine for launch
- Upgrade to Firebase later when you have users

This gets you LIVE in 10 minutes!
