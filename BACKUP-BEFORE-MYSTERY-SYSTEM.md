## Current State

### Plants Collection Page (plants.html)
- Shows all 20 plants in a grid
- Locked plants are grayscale with "LOCKED" overlay
- Shimmer effect on locked plants
- Full-size images, no plant names
- Click locked plants to go to shop
- Uses localStorage for ownership

### Plant Shop Page (plant-shop-new.html)
- Shows all plants with prices
- 1000 JAMCOINS starting currency
- Direct purchase model
- Rarity badges
- Saves purchases to localStorage

### Worker Images
- URL: https://eurorack-images.dawlessjammin.workers.dev
- Private R2 bucket: eurorackgridplants

### Current Ownership System
- Simple binary: owned/not owned
- Stored in localStorage as array of plant IDs
- No discovery/mystery mechanics
