# ðŸš€ EURORACKGRID LAUNCH PLAN - THE SMART WAY

## ðŸŽ¯ THE TRUTH: You don't need complex stuff to launch!

### What You ACTUALLY Need:
1. âœ… Your website files (you have 99 HTML pages ready!)
2. âœ… A place to host images (GitHub Pages - FREE)
3. âœ… A place to host the site (Netlify - FREE)
4. âœ… Your domain (eurorackgrid.com - you have it!)

## ðŸ“‹ STEP-BY-STEP LAUNCH (Takes 30 minutes)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Module Images
Since you don't have WebP files yet, here's what to do:

```bash
# Create webp folder
mkdir -p /Users/jade/eurogrid/frontend/webp

# For now, create placeholder image
# Later: Export from Procreate as 300x300px WebP files
```

**Procreate Export Settings:**
- Size: 300x300px (perfect square)
- Format: PNG first (convert to WebP later)
- Background: Transparent
- Quality: High

### Step 2: Host Images on GitHub (FREE Forever)
```bash
# Create new repo for assets
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: eurorackgrid-assets
3. Make it PUBLIC
4. Create repository

# Upload images
cd /Users/jade/eurogrid/frontend
git init
git add webp/
git commit -m "Add module images"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eurorackgrid-assets.git
git push -u origin main

# Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repo Settings
2. Pages â†’ Source â†’ Deploy from branch
3. Select: main branch, / (root)
4. Save

Your images are now at:
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/eurorackgrid-assets/webp/module-name.webp
```

### Step 3: Update Image URLs
```bash
# Quick script to update all image references
cd /Users/jade/eurogrid

# This updates all your HTML files to use GitHub Pages URLs
node update-to-github-pages.js
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify (Takes 2 minutes)
```bash
# Option A: Drag and drop
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag your 'frontend' folder onto the page
3. Done! You get a URL instantly

# Option B: Command line
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=frontend
```

### Step 5: Connect Your Domain
1. In Netlify â†’ Domain settings
2. Add custom domain: eurorackgrid.com
3. Update your domain's DNS:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to [your-site].netlify.app

## ðŸŽ¨ What About Module Images?

**For Launch:** 
- Use placeholder rectangles (you already have the ? squares)
- This is FINE for launch!

**After Launch:**
1. Create images in Procreate (300x300px)
2. Export as PNG
3. Convert to WebP using online tool
4. Upload to GitHub
5. They appear on site automatically!

## ðŸ’¾ What About User Data?

**For Launch:** Your localStorage system WORKS!
- Users can sign up
- Buy modules with jamnutz  
- Everything saves locally
- This is FINE for beta!

**After 100 users:** Move to Firebase
- But NOT needed for launch!

Your localStorage + Netlify + GitHub Pages stack is MORE than enough to start! ðŸŽ¯
