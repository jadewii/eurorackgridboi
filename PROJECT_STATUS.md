## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Local Testing
✅ Server running at: http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:8080
✅ All core features working locally

### Production Deployment
To deploy the site, you need to:

1. **Option 1: GitHub Pages (Easiest)**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Enable Pages in repository settings
   - Site will be at: `https://[username].github.io/eurogrid/`

2. **Option 2: Netlify (Manual)**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Drag and drop the `frontend` folder
   - Get instant URL

3. **Option 3: Vercel**
   - Visit https://vercel.com
   - Import GitHub repository
   - Deploy automatically

## 🔄 Current System Architecture

```
Frontend (Static HTML/JS)
├── User Authentication (localStorage)
├── Purchase System (localStorage)
├── Module Display (Supabase images)
└── Navigation (universal-nav.js)

No Backend Required
├── All data in localStorage
├── Images from Supabase CDN
└── No database needed
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Images**: Currently using Supabase URLs (working but could be faster)
2. **Data**: Using localStorage (not synced across devices)
3. **Mock Data**: Some sections use placeholder data (racks, plants)

## 📊 Test Checklist
