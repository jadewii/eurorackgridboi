# Navigation Fix Summary

## The Solution: Clean Nav System

We've implemented a **single source of truth** for navigation across ALL pages using two files:

### 1. `/assets/clean-nav.css`
- Defines the clean, borderless navigation style
- 0.9rem font, bold, uppercase
- Purple hover effect
- Fixed header positioning
- Kills any legacy button/border styles

### 2. `/assets/clean-nav.js`
- Automatically injects the SAME navigation on EVERY page
- Single array of links to maintain (edit once, updates everywhere)
- Removes any old navigation elements
- Highlights current page automatically

## How It Works

1. **Add these two lines to ANY page's `<head>`:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/clean-nav.css">
<script src="/assets/clean-nav.js" defer></script>
```

2. **Remove any hardcoded headers** from the body (the script injects it)

3. **That's it!** The page gets consistent navigation automatically

## Navigation Links Include:
- Home
- My Studio
- My Gear  
- My Modules
- Modules (collection)
- Racks
- Packs
- Panels
- Starter Kits
- Systems
- Vibe Shop
- Patches

## Pages Already Updated:
- starters.html ✅
- rack-shop.html ✅
- patches.html (needs update)
- collection.html (needs update)
- All other pages need the two lines added

## Why This Fixes Everything:
- **No more multiple navigation systems** - just one
- **No more bordered buttons** - CSS kills them
- **No more inconsistency** - every page uses the same nav
- **Easy to maintain** - edit the links array in clean-nav.js once
- **Impossible for old styles to come back** - CSS has kill switches

## Next Steps:
Add the two lines to every remaining HTML file and remove any hardcoded headers.
