# How to Organize Multiple Product Types

## ‚úÖ Your Store Now Supports Categories!

I've set up your store to handle multiple product types with easy filtering. Here's how it works:

## Current Categories Available

1. **T-Shirts** - Your main eurorack/synth shirts
2. **Hoodies** - Premium hoodies and sweatshirts  
3. **Accessories** - Mugs, tote bags, phone cases
4. **Art Prints** - Canvas prints, posters
5. **Stickers** - Vinyl stickers, sticker packs

## How Customers Use It

When someone visits your store:
1. They see **ALL products** by default
2. They can click category buttons to filter (T-Shirts, Hoodies, etc.)
3. The page instantly shows only that category
4. Product count updates to show how many items in each category

## Adding Products to Categories

### In Your Code (store.js):
Each product needs a `category` field:

```javascript
{
    id: 'your_product_id',
    title: 'Eurorack Oscillator Shirt',
    category: 'shirts',  // ‚Üê This determines the category!
    price: 29.99,
    // ... rest of product info
}
```

### Category Values to Use:
- `'shirts'` - For all t-shirts
- `'hoodies'` - For hoodies and sweatshirts
- `'accessories'` - For mugs, bags, phone cases
- `'prints'` - For posters, canvas prints
- `'stickers'` - For stickers

## Setting Up Your Product Mix

### Recommended Starting Lineup:

**T-Shirts (Your Main Focus)**
- 5-10 different eurorack/synth designs
- Multiple color options per design
- Sizes S-3XL

**Hoodies (Higher Profit)**
- 3-5 of your best designs
- Great for cold studios!
- $45-55 price point

**Accessories (Easy Add-ons)**
- Coffee mugs with synth jokes
- Tote bags for carrying cables
- Phone cases with module designs

**Stickers (Impulse Buys)**
- Individual synth brand parodies
- Patch point labels
- "No Input" warning stickers

## How to Add Products from Printify

### Method 1: Automatic Sync
1. In Printify, add tags to your products:
   - Tag shirts with "shirts"
   - Tag hoodies with "hoodies"
   - etc.
2. Run the sync script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node sync-products.js
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Setup
1. Get your product info from Printify
2. Edit `frontend/store.js`
3. Add to the correct category section:

```javascript
// Example: Adding a new eurorack shirt

    id: 'printify_123456',
    title: 'VCO Life T-Shirt',
    category: 'shirts',  // Important!
    price: 27.99,
    image: 'your-product-image-url',
    printifyId: 'printify_123456',
    variants: [
        { id: 'v1', name: 'Small - Black' },
        { id: 'v2', name: 'Medium - Black' },
        // etc.
    ]
}
```
