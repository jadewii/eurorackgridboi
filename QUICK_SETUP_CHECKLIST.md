## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**"No products found"**
- Make sure products are PUBLISHED in Printify
- Check API key is correct
- Verify Shop ID matches

**"Authentication failed"**
- Regenerate your API token
- Make sure you saved .env file
- No extra spaces in the token

**Products showing wrong category**
- Edit the category field in printify-products.js
- Categories: shirts, hoodies, accessories, prints, stickers

## ðŸ“ž Still Stuck?

Run this to see what's happening:
```bash
cd backend
cat .env  # Check your keys (hide token when sharing!)
node sync-printify-products.js  # Try syncing again
```

Remember: You're almost there! Just need those API keys! ðŸŽ‰
